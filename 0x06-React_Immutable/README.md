Immutable.js (v5.0.2)
Immutable data encourages pure functions (data-in, data-out) and lends itself to much simpler application development and enabling techniques from functional programming such as lazy evaluation.

While designed to bring these powerful functional concepts to JavaScript, it presents an Object-Oriented API familiar to Javascript engineers and closely mirroring that of Array, Map, and Set. It is easy and efficient to convert to and from plain Javascript types.
